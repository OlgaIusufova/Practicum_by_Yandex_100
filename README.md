# Project_01. Analyzing borrowers' risk of defaulting
Your project is to prepare a report for a bank’s loan division. You’ll need to find out if a customer’s marital status and number of children have an impact on whether they will default on a loan. The bank already has some data on customers’ credit worthiness. <br>
Your report will be considered when building a credit score for a potential customer. A credit score is used to evaluate the ability of a potential borrower to repay their loan.

Your job is to analyze clients' behavior and determine which prepaid plan brings in more revenue.

# Project_04. Identifying patterns that determine the success of games 

You work for the online store Ice, which sells video games all over the world. User and expert reviews, genres, platforms (e.g. Xbox or PlayStation), and historical data on game sales are available from open sources. You need to identify patterns that determine whether a game succeeds or not. This will allow you to spot potential big winners and plan advertising campaigns.
<br>In front of you is data going back to 2016. Let’s imagine that it’s December 2016 and you’re planning a campaign for 2017.
<br>(The important thing is to get experience working with data. It doesn't really matter whether you're forecasting 2017 sales based on data from 2016 or 2017 sales based on data from 2016.)
<br>The dataset contains the abbreviation ESRB. The Entertainment Software Rating Board evaluates a game's content and assigns an age rating such as Teen or Mature.

# Project_08. Analysis of user behavior in the food application

You work at a startup that sells food products. You need to investigate user behavior for the company's app.
<br> First study the sales funnel. Find out how users reach the purchase stage. How many users actually make it to this stage? How many get stuck at previous stages? Which stages in particular?
<br> Then look at the results of an A/A/B test. (Read on for more information about A/A/B testing.) The designers would like to change the fonts for the entire app, but the managers are afraid the users might find the new design intimidating. They decide to make a decision based on the results of an A/A/B test.
<br> The users are split into three groups: two control groups get the old fonts and one test group gets the new ones. Find out which set of fonts produces better results.
<br> Creating two A groups has certain advantages. We can make it a principle that we will only be confident in the accuracy of our testing when the two control groups are similar. If there are significant differences between the A groups, this can help us uncover factors that may be distorting the results. Comparing control groups also tells us how much time and data we'll need when running further tests.
<br> You'll be using the same dataset for general analytics and for A/A/B analysis. In real projects, experiments are constantly being conducted. Analysts study the quality of an app using general data, without paying attention to whether users are participating in experiments.
